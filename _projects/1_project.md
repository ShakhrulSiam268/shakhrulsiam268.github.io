Presenting my project on real-time video analysis and insight generation from multiple camera networks in a retail outlet. In a world where video cameras are ubiquitous, manual monitoring has proven to be both time-consuming and resource-intensive. That's where the power of AI steps in to revolutionize the way we gather insights.


This cutting-edge solution continuously analyzes video frames captured by multiple cameras strategically placed throughout the outlet. The result? A comprehensive customer engagement report overlaid on a dynamic floor plan.

The generated insights provide a deep understanding of customer behavior, movement patterns, and popular areas of interest. This actionable data empowers authorities to make impactful decisions about outlet rearrangement and optimization.


Leveraging AI in this context not only saves valuable time but also enhances decision-making accuracy by transforming raw video data into meaningful insights.


Let's automate, innovate, and unlock a new era of data-driven decision-making.
