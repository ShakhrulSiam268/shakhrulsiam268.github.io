  abstract="This paper introduces ChirpTransformer, a versatile LoRa encoding framework that harnesses broad chirp features to dynamically modulate data, enhancing network coverage, throughput, and energy efficiency. Unlike the standard LoRa encoder that offers only single configurable chirp feature, our framework introduces four distinct chirp features, expanding the spectrum of methods available for data modulation. To implement these features on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) LoRa nodes, we utilize a combination of a software design and a hardware interrupt. ChirpTransformer serves as the foundation for optimizing encoding and decoding in three specific case studies: weak signal decoding for extended network coverage, concurrent transmission for heightened network throughput, and data rate adaptation for improved network energy efficiency. Each case study involves the development of an end-to-end system to comprehensively evaluate its performance. The evaluation results demonstrate remarkable enhancements compared to the standard LoRa. Specifically, ChirpTransformer achieves a 2.38 × increase in network coverage, a 3.14 × boost in network throughput, and a 3.93 × of battery lifetime."

  abstract="The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) has given rise to a new paradigm known as the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of AIoT research. We examine AIoT literature related to sensing, computing, and networking & communication, which form the three key components of AIoT. In addition to advancements in these areas, we review domain-specific AIoT systems that are designed for various important application domains. We have also created an accompanying GitHub repository, where we compile the papers included in this survey: https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/AIoT-Survey. This repository will be actively maintained and updated with new research as it becomes available. As both IoT and AI become increasingly critical to our society, we believe AIoT is emerging as an essential research field at the intersection of IoT and modern AI. We hope this survey will serve as a valuable resource for those engaged in AIoT research and act as a catalyst for future explorations to bridge gaps and drive advancements in this exciting field."

  abstract="This paper proposes a dual-purpose braille system for the visually impaired people. There are two main features of this system- object detection and optical character recognition. Real time object detection will help a visually impaired person to know about the things around him and optical character recognition will help him reading characters in both international (English) and local community (Bengali) language. In this paper, the detailed methodology of our proposed method is described. A pre-trained convolutional neural network (AlexNet) is used for classifying the objects and an OCR engine (Tesseract) along with basic image processing is used for optical character recognition. A refreshable braille display is also designed to show the braille characters."

  abstract="This paper outlines a technical method for video analysis that may be used to identify persons in footage from several CCTV cameras and provide a heatmap of that information for a certain floor layout. The analysis of customer and employee behavior in retail and office settings, as well as motion tracking and advertising effectiveness research, can all be aided by the automatic creation of people density maps. With the use of video recordings made by common video surveillance cameras, density maps were created. We made advantage of CCTV cameras, which are dispersed across a retail establishment. Because the Yolov5 object detection algorithm may produce findings more quickly, we have chosen to employ it for human detection. Additionally, due to the short inference time, it is appropriate for real-time applications."

  abstract="Sleep disorders are a common problem that disrupts our regular sleeping patterns. To diagnose sleep disorders, Long-term monitoring of sleep could be useful. In this paper an automated scheme of sleep staging is presented based on Bioradiolocation signals using time and frequency domain feature extraction and Random Forest Classifier. This experiment is val idated using data of 32 subjects without sleep-related breathing disorders. A Random Forest based algorithm is used for two, three, four and five-stage classification. We achieved the best performance so far (89.35% accuracy and 0.65 Cohens kappa) on 2-stage, 75.3% accuracy on 3-stage, 56.18% on 4-stage, and 54.2% accuracy on 5-stage classification with BRL Signals. These results show high potential in real-life sleep stage monitoring systems."
