I  am Md. Shakhrul Iman Siam.  Second-year Ph.D. Student, Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://cse.osu.edu/). I am currently working as a Graduate Research Associate at OSU AIoT and Machine Learning Systems Lab under the supervision of [Prof. Mi Zhang](https://mi-zhang.github.io/). 

I completed my undergraduate studies in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) from [Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://eee.buet.ac.bd/).

Before starting my PhD, I worked for 2.5 years in Industry as a Machine Learning Engineer. I built various computer vision solutions that have very high business Impact. Currently, I am working on the design and implementation of the Efficient Large Language Model.
